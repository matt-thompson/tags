# Tags Framework

> The Tags framework lets you build Web applications by extending HTML. It provides
  a mechanism for defining and instantiating object types from XML or Javascript descriptions.
  A built-in object type called View allows standard HTML5 tags as well as custom tags
  to be rendered into the DOM and manipulated. The Tags Framework provides an attractive
  alternative to the template-oriented approach currently in vogue.
