# Tags Framework Example

> The Tags Framework lets you implement custom tags in Javascript. This makes it easy to bind event handlers to DOM elements, create and manipu 
dynamic HTML and implement widgets with an HTML interface. This may just be the missing paradigm that makes HTML and Javascript work together like they were made for each other.
